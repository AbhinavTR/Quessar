    <h2>🚀 Why We Built Quessar™</h2>
    <p>In a city that never sleeps, EVs were supposed to be silent — but their charging problems are anything but quiet.</p>
    <p><strong>Public charging stations are often:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crowded or broken</li>
      <li>Noisy with generators</li>
      <li>Inconveniently located</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We started <strong>Quessar™</strong> to fix this.</p>
    <p>Our goal is simple:<br />
    <strong>Bring clean, quiet power to your EV — wherever you are.</strong></p>
    <p>Whether you're at home, at work, or parked on the street, Quessar™ dispatches a silent mobile charging unit directly to you. It’s quiet, efficient, and contactless.</p>
    <p>We’re a proudly Indian startup:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🚀 Recognized by Startup India</li>
      <li>✅ UDYAM Registered</li>
      <li>🔒 Provisional Patent Filed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We're launching in select areas soon — starting with <strong>Bangalore</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you're an EV rider, delivery partner, fleet operator, or investor interested in supporting India's clean mobility future — we’d love to connect.</p>
